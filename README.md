### modeling-perchlorate-reduction

Models for understanding the interaction between perchlorate-reducing bacteria and chlorate-reducing bacteria. Used to produce:

- Figure 4: Simulation of perchlorate reduction with and without chlorate-reducing bacteria
- Supplemental Figure 4: Variation of initial concentrations of cells or perchlorate
- Supplemental Figure 5: Variation of Km for perchlorate or chlorate
